2 Hours Challenge - Drink Order

## Develop Logic
Our goal is to show exist orders, create new order, maintain order, delete order. It is easy to use framework to complete this. For example, just use AngularJs and AngularJs have data-binding property and you don't need to render view by yourself. I use easy css to accomplish responsive web design and then use plain JavaScript to reach the goal. Just define 
exist orders array and CRUD orders render to the view.

## Challenge Feedback
It is a easy challenge to test whether you are familiar with JavaScript and frontend framework. I decide to choose plain JavaScript and Library JQuery to finsh this test, if needed I can also complete it by AngularJs or Vue.js. To be honest, I am not good at beauty design and my backend ability is better than frontend ability. Thank you for this chance to test myself.
